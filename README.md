# Team 1777's Visual Studio Code test

This repository contains our off-season code for 2018 Power Up. We created this to try out 2019's VSCode + GradleRIO development system before kickoff to prevent any surprises. It worked almost flawlessly during development and at the 2018 Cow Town Throwdown off-season competition, and we're excited to see what improvements WPI has in store for the official plugin release at kickoff.

We also used this code to test out a few things:
- Configuration system to allow multiple drivers to set up their own sensitivities and button mappings
- Helper class for the MB1013 distance sensor
- P loops for more accurate turning during autonomous
